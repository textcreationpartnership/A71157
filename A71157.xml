         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True RELATION Of a Late Barbarous ASSAULT Committed upon <hi>ROBERT PYE</hi>

            </head>
            <p>WHether it be Folly or Madneſs for the Papiſts to give ſuch bloody Experiments of their Cruelty, is a thing which one would think might be eaſily determin'd among Chriſtians. And yet they have their witty as well as their crafty Defenders of all their Villanies. Certainly at length Men will take the Meaſure of <hi>Hercules</hi> by his Foot, and gueſs at their Sanguine Deſigns of General Maſſacres, by their Violent Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages upon particular perſons. One would think that it were an Article of the Roman Catholick Faith to murther Proteſtant Juſtices of the Peace. Ever ſince the Diſcovery of the Plot, they have been committing ſome Villany or other. They began with Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godfrey;</hi> the next Object of their revenge was Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> and now we are to give you the Relation of another Exploit no leſs wicked then either; God, as we have great Reaſon to believe, ſtill hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their hearts, to open the eyes of thoſe that blindly defend their Cauſe, and labour to extenuate their Crimes.</p>
            <p>Since the Diſcovery of the late Plot, it is well known what care has been taken to give orders to ſeveral Juſtices of the Peace in their ſeveral Stations to watch the Deſigns and Proceedings of the Papiſts, and to take care of the Publick Tranquillity in their ſeveral Counties. In Purſuance of which Orders ſeveral Warrants were granted at the Quarter-Seſſions for the County of <hi>Hereford</hi> againſt one <hi>John Bodnam</hi> of <hi>Brunguin</hi> in the ſaid County <abbr>Eſq</abbr> as being known to be an obſtinate and violent Papiſt, and one that ſtill refuſed to take the Oaths which the Law required, or to Obey any Warrant either of any ſingle Juſtice of the Peace, or joyntly Sign'd at the Seſſions, but keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe in his Houſe as his Garriſon, defended himſelf againſt the Conſtables, and their Aſſiſtants, ſome of whom he hath ſhot and wounded. This Mr. <hi>Rod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> living near to a Place called the <hi>Meene,</hi> the Manſion-Houſe of <hi>Robert Pye</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of his Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace for the ſame County, an Eminent and Worthy Proteſtant, and a Gentleman of great Honour and Value in his Country, and now to be lamented with an equal ſorrow to that which bewaild the fall of Sir <hi>Edmond-bury Godſrey,</hi> ſo like to his; the ſaid Mr. <hi>Pye,</hi> could not but think it a Scandal to the Government, and a great neglect of his Duty, in regard of his Office, that ſo notorious a Papiſt ſhould live as it were under his Noſe, ſo openly refractory, and in a rebellious defiance of the Law. For which reaſon he gave out a Warrant for his Apprehenſion, which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable being afraid to Execute alone, he therefore ſent ſome of his own ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to Aid and Aſſiſt him. But Mr. <hi>Bodnam,</hi> keeping his doors faſt, defended himſelf ſo well, or rather ſo ill, that the Conſtable and his Aſſiſtance were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retire and leave him, for the ſafety of their lives, then which a <hi>Tore,</hi> or an <hi>Out-law</hi> could have done no more.</p>

            <!-- PDF PAGE 39 -->
            <p>Sometime after this, that is to ſay, on the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> laſt, it was Mr. <hi>Pyes</hi> misfortune to ſpye his unruly Neighbour <hi>Bodnam,</hi> walking in his own grounds; whereupon, having at the ſame time an Order of Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the ſaid Mr. <hi>Bodnam</hi>'s Apprehenſion about him, and bethinking with himſelf, that his Oath and the Duty of his Place, in Honour o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd him to apprehend an Offender who had ſo often offended; he went to him, and commanded him to ſurrender himſelf as a Priſoner to the Law. Mr. <hi>Bodnam,</hi> having a Hedg-Bill in his hand, replied according to the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Language of his Popiſh Litany, (Dam me) <hi>Stand off, or I'll cleave you down.</hi> The Juſtice made anſwer, Mr. <hi>Bodnam, You know I am too much a Man to ſear you.</hi> For it ſeems he had formerly hand to hand taken him Priſoner, and let him go upon his parole, which he afterwards perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and diſhonourably broke; and for his juſtification ſent him word, That no Faith was to be kept with Hereticks. Mr. <hi>Pye,</hi> having therefore given him to underſtand, as before, that he did not fear him, told him further in theſe words, <hi>I came not now as a ſingle perſon to fight you, but as a Magiſtrate, according to Law, to apprehend you; and therefore I require you to ſurrender your ſelf peaceably:</hi> Which Mr. <hi>Bodnam</hi> refuſing to do, Mr. <hi>Pye</hi> bravely and vigorouſly preſs'd in upon him, which this ſame Papiſtical Butcher perceiving, ſtepp'd back, and in good earneſt let ſly at his head with his Hedg-Bill (no bad Argument for the truth of the Black Bills prepared for the Papiſts in <hi>Ireland</hi>) and having ſtunn'd the valiant Magiſtrate with the firſt, with the ſecond blow ſell'd him to the ground; preſently company coming in prevented the immediate Murther of the Gentleman and ſeized upon the Criminal <hi>Bodnam.</hi> The Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. <hi>Pye</hi> recovered his Senſes ſometime after, but it was only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his Pain: For after he had continued ill about Eighteen days in a lingring condition, upon the 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> laſt he departed this lifer, the Sacrifice of Papiſtical Diſobedience and Rebellion, not only to the unſpeakable Grief of his Family and Relations, but of all who had the Honour to be acquainted with him. Nor is he leſs lamented by all the true Proteſtants as well in the ſame, as in the Adjacent Counties. 'Tis true the Murtherer will be doubtſeſs hang'd; but here is the ſeverity of the Exchange, We have loſt an Induſtrious and Valiant Magiſtrate; the Papiſts only a looſe baſe Butcherly Villain.</p>
            <p>This is now the Second Prank that has been play'd in <hi>Hereford ſhire,</hi> or by men of that County, the worſt of Contagions, ſhould it from thence ſpread any farther. Here are fair warnings and fair diſcoveries of the very bottoms of the Papiſts hearts, but they coſt too dear. Here is a petty Kingdom, that is to ſay, a whole Family, put into a fatal Confuſion at two blows, to ſhew their Deſigns were real againſt, the Great Maſter of the Univerſal Family of the Nation. And theſe are the barbarous Effects of Popiſh Zeal, from which Good Lord deliver us.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis a hundred to one, but that as ſoon as this ſame Caitiff ſhall be hang'd, the Papiſts will deny that ever there were any ſuch Perſons as Mr. <hi>Pye</hi> or <hi>Bodnam,</hi> and perhaps that there is any ſuch County of <hi>Hereford.</hi> But ſuch Blots in their Scutcheons as theſe, will not be ſo eaſily wiped away. But they will find the Engliſh Inquiſition after Blood, to be as reſplute as their own Spaniſh Inquiſition after Hereſy; and therefore his <hi>Holyneſs</hi> would do well to admoniſh his Creatures to proceed with leſs paſſion, and to be more Submiſſive to the Commands and Orders of their Temporal Princes.</p>
